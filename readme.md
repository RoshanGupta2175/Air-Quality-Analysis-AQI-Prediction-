🌍 India Air Quality Analysis & AQI Prediction
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes air quality data from major Indian cities and predicts the Air Quality Index (AQI) using machine learning techniques. It focuses on understanding pollution trends, identifying key pollutants, and building a predictive model to estimate AQI values.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze air quality trends across multiple Indian cities

Identify major pollutants affecting AQI

Build a machine learning model for AQI prediction

Generate meaningful insights through data visualization
